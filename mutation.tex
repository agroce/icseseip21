\\ \rvt{rvt asks: for the reader, what does mutation score represent? (feel free to explain inside this caption)
\\ \rvt{rvt says: probably we only need the filename(s) and not the path for presentation--will save space and this table could fit into one col. small potatoes right now though.}
\\ \rvt{rvt asks: Coverage here represents coverage of the file--I think it would be good to provide the average coverage per project too, to give an overall sense for the project. We should caveat in the discussion, what this number means, i.e., it is representative only of the subset of things we did to try determine coverage, and not necessarily an accurate signal of testing quality, because we might miss, e.g., integration test coverage or I don't know what. So this is more to satisfy a ``here's the data if you want to form a picture in your head of testing as per what we observed''}

We used the universal mutator

mutate the code.

\subsection{Comparison with Other Cryptocurrency Codebases}

We use universal mutator to compare Bitcoin's testing quality with other popular cryptocurrencies. Transaction validation logic was targeted
due to this logic being very critical and having a high likelihood to cause high severity issues in the case a bug was caught. To select
our corpus, we examined the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap. We eliminate stable cryptocurrencies, such as USD coin,
because they do not have transaction validation logic analagous to bitcoin. For each project, we also run coverage collection
tools in order to compare code coverage. If a project does not build or have coverage, we also exclude it from our comparison.

In the end, the following projects failed to compile: Binance Coin, Polkadot, Chainlink and the following projects did not have
readily accessable coverage reports: Stellar.

In deciding what files to mutate, we select the core transaction validation logic, by filtering for files
with tx, transaction, verify, and validate. Following this, we manually inspected each matching file and select
ones that directly relate to transaction validation. The results for these experiments are displayed in Table \ref{tab:comparison}.
