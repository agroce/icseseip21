\section{Trying Swarm Fuzzing}

DeepState~\cite{goodman2018deepstate} provides strong support for swarm fuzzing.  However, while there are similarities to the bitcoin core developed infrastucture for fuzz targets and the DeepState API, re-writing the fuzz targets to use DeepState is too large an effort for the likely payoff at this time, even though DeepState would also provide additional fuzzer diversity.
