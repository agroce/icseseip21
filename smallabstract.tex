Bitcoin is one of the most prominent distributed software systems in the world.  This paper describes an effort to investigate and enhance the effectiveness of the Bitcoin Core fuzzing effort.  The effort initially began as a query about how to escape \emph{saturation} in the fuzzing effort, but developed into a more general exploration.  This paper summarizes the outcomes of a two-week focused effort.  While the effort found no smoking guns indicating major test/fuzz weaknesses, it produced a large number of additional fuzz corpus entries, increased the set of fuzzers used for Bitcoin Core, and ran mutation analysis of Bitcoin Core fuzz targets, with a comparison to Bitcoin functional tests and other cryptocurrencies' tests. Our conclusion is that for high quality fuzzing efforts, improvements to the \emph{oracle} may be the best way to get more out of fuzzing.
