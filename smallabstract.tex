Bitcoin is one of the most prominent distributed software systems in the world.  This paper describes an effort to investigate and enhance the effectiveness of the Bitcoin Core implementation fuzzing effort.  The effort initially began as a query about how to escape \emph{saturation} in the fuzzing effort, but developed into a more general exploration once it was determined that saturation was largely a byproduct of the (then) fuzzing configuration.  This paper reports the process and outcomes of the two-week focused effort that emerged from that initial contact between Chaincode Labs and academic researchers.  That effort found no smoking guns indicating major test/fuzz weaknesses. However, it produced a large number of additional fuzz corpus entries to add to the Bitcoin QA assets, clarified some long-standing problems in OSS-Fuzz triage, increased the set of documented fuzzers used in Bitcoin Core testing, and ran the first (to our knowledge) mutation analysis of Bitcoin Core's fuzz targets, with a comparison to Bitcoin functional tests and other cryptocurrencies' tests. Our conclusion is that for well-designed fuzzing efforts, improvements to the \emph{oracle} side of testing, increasing invariant checks and assertions, may be the best route to getting more out of fuzzing.
