\section{How Good is the Bitcoin Core Testing and Fuzzing?}


stuff

For both fuzzing and functional tests, some missing coverage and some
unkilled mutants are almost
certainly (and stated to be such by Bitcoin Core team members to us)
redundant or defensive code to protect against ``impossible''
problems.  This is unsurprising in code intended to be highly reliable;
coverage of core file system functionality was only 89\% during a year of
extensive random testing of a file system developed for the Curiosity
Mars Rover performed by NASA/JPL's Laboratory for Reliable
Software~\cite{ICSEDiff}.  The missing coverage was mostly defensive,
redundant code, including fail-safe termination after (presumably
impossible without hardware failure)
assertion failures.
