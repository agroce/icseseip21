\section{How Good is the Bitcoin Core Testing and Fuzzing?}

In a sense this is a fundamentally hard question to answer: certainly,
an 80 hour effort by one fuzzing researcher, who was generally
familliar with blockchain and Bitcoin technology, but not at all
familliar with the Bitcoin Core implementation, in terms of high level
approach, testing infrastructure, or (of course) detailed codebase,
cannot provide anything like a definitive answer to that question.

The initial fuzzing effort, at the time of contact, was suboptimal,
and hence seemed to be facing a difficult saturation problem.
However, the simplest advice (run the fuzzers longer, add the system
to OSS-Fuzz, try more fuzzers) was sufficient to make the
fundamentally sound fuzzing basis more useful.

Additional efforts to improve the fuzzing added some value in terms of
new corpus entries, and paved
the way for better documented, and more systematic, application of a
variety of fuzzers.  Fundamentally, however, these improvements were
relatively small compared to the overall scope of Bitcoin testing.
This was partly due to the limited timeframe, but not due to either a
lack of expertise or serious attempts to improve fuzzing, given that
timeframe, we believe.

The basic cause of the limited improvement was that, at present,
Bitcoin Core has a well-designed and effective fuzzing infrastructure.

For both fuzzing and functional tests, some missing coverage and some
unkilled mutants are almost
certainly (and stated to be such by Bitcoin Core team members to us)
redundant or defensive code to protect against ``impossible''
problems.  This is unsurprising in code intended to be highly reliable;
coverage of core file system functionality was only 89\% during a year of
extensive random testing of a file system developed for the Curiosity
Mars Rover performed by NASA/JPL's Laboratory for Reliable
Software~\cite{ICSEDiff}.  The missing coverage was mostly defensive,
redundant code, including fail-safe termination after (presumably
impossible without hardware failure)
assertion failures.
